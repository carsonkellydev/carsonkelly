- ðŸŒ± Welcome, Iâ€™m Carson! I am a self-taught software developer with a focus in Javascript.
- ðŸŒ± When I am not coding, I am spending time on my many hobbies like home improvement projects, dancing, and listening to music. Sometimes, when I have nothing to do, I devote myself to learning new skills. If you talk to me one on one, test me on my Spanish! I've been learning it for 5+ years! 
- ðŸŒ± You can contact me via the phone number & email listed on my resume. Let's connect! 
- ðŸŒ± If you're talking code, you're speaking my language!
